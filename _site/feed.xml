&lt;h2 id=&quot;when&quot;&gt;When&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 20th - Apr 6th 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internship at Front&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who&quot;&gt;Who&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, Kaiser, Rishi, Deen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-things-i-did-to-survive&quot;&gt;The Things I did to survive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I washed dishes with hand soap and a spare toothbrush.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used my boxers as bath mats when getting out of the shower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borrowed some utensils and plates from work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took toilet paper from a hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borrowed some towels from the local YMCA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took my switch to work to download the latest Smash Ultimate update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-wish&quot;&gt;Things I wish…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish my room was bigger than a closet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish cracked out homeless men didn’t yell at me when I’m just trying to go home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I didn’t see a naked man yelling outside our door as he struggled to  put his pants on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I didn’t have to see poop on my way to work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I didn’t have to look sad, miserable, and poor to avoid drawing attention from the homeless.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I had wifi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I didn’t run out of data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish Rishi brought something useful for me. He had options between a trash can, floor mat, and utensils. But he decided to bring a scale (Or a “weighing machine” as he called it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-love&quot;&gt;Things I love…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love that I get to live in the city in an apartment that’s walking distance to my office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love that I get to live with my friends and I love these friends are people that I look up to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love the the homey, cozy feeling of my room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love that the apartment is clean (or was clean until Kaiser moved in)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love that Rishi and Kaiser found an apartment early so I had a place to live in the city. (Kaiser moved in 2/15. Rishi moved in 3/1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love my routine with Kaiser of getting dinner at Coinbase  and working out at the Embarcadaro YMCA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love not needing a car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;highlights&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To be continutued…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lowlights&quot;&gt;Lowlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;H1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;H2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;H3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;H4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;h5&quot;&gt;H5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;h6&quot;&gt;H6&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;alt-h1&quot;&gt;Alt-H1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alt-h2&quot;&gt;Alt-H2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasis, aka italics, with &lt;em&gt;asterisks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;underscores&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong emphasis, aka bold, with &lt;strong&gt;asterisks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;underscores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined emphasis with &lt;strong&gt;asterisks and &lt;em&gt;underscores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikethrough uses two tildes. &lt;del&gt;Scratch this.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actual numbers don’t matter, just that it’s a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And another item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we’ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unordered list can use asterisks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or minuses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or pluses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;&gt;I’m an inline-style link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google's Homepage&quot;&gt;I’m an inline-style link with title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;I’m a reference-style link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;I’m a relative reference to a repository file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or leave it empty and use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com&quot;&gt;link text itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s our logo (hover to see the title text):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Logo Title Text 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference-style: 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Logo Title Text 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;blockquotes&quot;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
This line is part of the same quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let’s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; into a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;Horizontal Rule&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three or more…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyphens&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asterisks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscores&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm slowly getting better. I think it all started with Phil 27, an ethics class that I was required to take. Most notably, Peter Singer's essay, &quot;Famine Affluence, and Morality.&quot;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently livintg in small apartment off of 6th and Naotma. 6th Street is definitely a sketchy. The kind that people tend to avoid when the suns down. My room is about the size of closet, but it's homey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several modes of transportation. The first is my skateboard&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
