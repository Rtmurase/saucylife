<p>Hello! This website was supposed to be private, but now since you're already here. Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some of my deepest thoughts, my current direction in life, reviews on things that I find interesting, etc.</p>

<p>I've always wanted a personal website, but my first one was pretty lame. It was just a bootstrap template that contained my latest projects linkes to my others profiles. Now I'm using a Jekyll Boostrap template and will instead write about things that I find interesting.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I hope you find some of this content interesting. This website will continue to be public until I find a way to make it private. So enjoy while you can.</p>
